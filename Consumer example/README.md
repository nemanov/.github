# GitHub Settings as code for consumer repositories

This is a guide about managing GitHub repository settings as a code.

## Base configuration

The base configuration is stored in the `.github`repository. This repository is not available for regular users. Consumer repositories extend base configuration from the `.github`repository.
Consumers may redefine settings from the base configuration. In that case, the settings defined by user and the base settings will be merged.

## Usage

To have settings as code a consumer repository must have a `settings.yml` file inside a `.github` folder.

**Example of settings.yml with redefined settings `./github/settings.yml`**:
```
# Repository settings are inherited from the base configuration taken from .github repository
# You can redefine needed settings after `_extends` directive
# Version of the base configuration: 1.0.0
_extends: .github

repository:
  # See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#update-a-repository for all available settings.

# Either `true` to allow rebase-merging pull requests, or `false` to prevent
  # rebase-merging.
  allow_rebase_merge: true
  
branches:
  - name: main
    # https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#update-branch-protection
    # Branch Protection settings. Set to null to disable
    protection:
      # Required. Require at least one approving review on a pull request, before merging. Set to null to disable.
      required_pull_request_reviews:
        # The number of approvals required. (1-6)
        required_approving_review_count: 1
```

## Updating settings

The settings are applied only when the `./github/settings.yml` file is changed in a **default** branch. This means that if the base settings were changed, the update of settings inside a consumer repository won't be triggered automatically.
There is a comment with base settings version inside the `settings.yml` file to overcome this problem. When the settings in the base repo are changed you can edit this comment and change the version, to trigger the settings synchronization.

**Future steps**:
- Write an automation that will change the settings version inside consumers after base were changed to trigger the settings synchronization
